# **Testing and Implementation of GPT2 based tweet generation**
I have implemented an AI based tweet generation with the prediction model. Further, I have tested it using POSTMAN.

# **Running the scripts**
I have put model .pkl files within the Week2 folder. The following is the sample .json for testing the api.

{
    "company": "Tesla",
    "tweet_type": "announcement",
    "message": "We're unveiling something big!"
}
